# Professional Portfolio

This is my brand new professional portfolio. The first portfolio I made was back in February 2021 with only HTML and CSS. I wanted to approach this portfolio using the new skill I have learned in Rutgers' Coding Bootcamp, namely Bootstrap. Here you will find a more polished and interactive page for the user.

### Weather Dashboard-Find Current Weather and 5 Day Forecast Data!

## 1. Description
​
My motivation for this project was to rework and rebrand myself by creating a new professional portfolio using Bootstrap. This page offers the users a more enhanced visual and interactive experience. Additionally, the page is fully responsive and has various icons and buttons that will take the user to my social media pages and my resume.
